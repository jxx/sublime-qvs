# QlikView Package for Sublime Text
This is a QlikView script syntax package for the wonderful text editor
Sublime Text.

Since Textmate packages can be used in Sublime Text it will probably work the other
way as well but it haven't been tested.

## Installation
Even though this could techincally be used in Linux+Mac as well I see really no big use for it.
QlikView, which is required to actualy make use of the script, is only available on Windows.
Thats why the following instructions are __for Windows only__

### Using Git 
This is the way to go if you wan't to help out developing the package.

* Open a command prompt
* Go to %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages
* git clone git://github.com/kmpm/sublime-qvs.git QlikView
* Restart Sublime Text

### Files only
* Download a zip file of the current code from https://github.com/kmpm/sublime-qvs/zipball/master
* Unzip the files within to %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages\QlikView
* Restart Sublime Text
